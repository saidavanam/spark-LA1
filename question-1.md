Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing framework that was developed to address the limitations of Hadoop MapReduce and enable faster and more flexible big data processing. It was initially created at the University of California, Berkeley's AMPLab, and later became an Apache Software Foundation project. Let's discuss the history of Apache Spark, including its major versions and releases.

1. **Genesis (2009-2010)**:
   - Spark was initially developed as a research project at UC Berkeley's AMPLab in 2009.
   - It was introduced as a response to the limitations of Hadoop MapReduce, aiming to provide a faster and more versatile framework for big data processing.
   - In 2010, the first research paper on Spark was published, introducing concepts like Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) that are at the core of Spark's design.

2. **Apache Incubation (2013)**:
   - In June 2013, Spark became an Apache Software Foundation (ASF) incubator project, marking the beginning of its journey as an open-source project.
   - The first Apache Spark release, version 0.7.0, was made available in March 2013.

3. **Version 1.0 (2014)**:
   - In May 2014, Apache Spark reached version 1.0, signaling its maturity and stability.
   - This release marked an important milestone for the project and highlighted its growing adoption in the big data community.

4. **Version 1.6 (2016)**:
   - Apache Spark 1.6, released in January 2016, brought several enhancements and improvements to the framework.
   - It introduced features like Dataset and DataFrames API, making Spark more user-friendly and efficient for structured data processing.

5. **Version 2.0 (2016)**:
   - In July 2016, Apache Spark 2.0 was released, introducing major changes and features.
   - Structured Streaming was introduced, enabling real-time stream processing using a unified API.
   - The introduction of the Catalyst optimizer improved query optimization and execution.

6. **Version 2.4 (2018)**:
   - Apache Spark 2.4, released in November 2018, focused on improving the performance, stability, and ease of use.
   - It introduced ANSI SQL compliance, vectorized UDFs, and various other enhancements.

7. **Version 3.0 (2020)**:
   - Apache Spark 3.0, released in June 2020, marked a significant milestone for the project.
   - It introduced several key features, including Adaptive Query Execution, improved ANSI SQL support, and better Python integration.

8. **Version 3.1 (2021)**:
   - Apache Spark 3.1, released in March 2021, continued to improve performance and introduced features like dynamic partition pruning and better support for SQL analytics.

9. **Version 3.2 (2022)**:
   - Apache Spark 3.2 was expected to be released in 2022, but I don't have information on the specific release date or features included in this version due to my knowledge cutoff date.


## 9)Version 3.2(2023):
- Resolved over 1,700 Jira tickets.
-Includes stability fixes in the latest version 3.2.4 (April 2023).
- Ex:-Pandas API support,RocksDB StateStore,Session window support,Push-based shuffle,ANSI SQL mode GA.

- Apache Spark continues to evolve, with each release bringing new features, optimizations, and improvements to the framework.->It has become a popular choice for big data processing, machine learning, and real-time analytics due to its versatility and performance.->Users and organizations continue to contribute to and benefit from the Spark ecosystem, making it a vibrant and active open-source project
